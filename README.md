 ##  WELCOME TO MY DELI-SHOP 🥪

The goal of my application is to streamline the order process for a sandwich shop.
Customers can fully customize sandwiches by selecting bread types, sizes, and toppings,
add drinks, chips, choose from signature sandwiches, and manage multiple items in a single order. 
All orders are saved with timestamped receipts for easy tracking.

## Home Menu

#### Upon launching the program, users are presented with a main menu containing two options:

## An interesting piece of code 
One interesting part of my code is the checkout section. It makes sure the user can’t check out without ordering at least one item, which helps prevent invalid orders.
Then it displays the full order details and asks the user to confirm before saving the receipt.
If the user confirms, the program saves the order using the ReceiptFileManager, showing how the system connects user interaction with file storage.
